# Understanding Risk Appetite and Operational Risk Management

This codelab provides an interactive guide to understanding risk appetite and its crucial role in operational risk management. Through the use of a Streamlit application, you'll explore how risk tolerance levels impact organizational risk profiles and capital management. This codelab uses simplified, synthetic data to illustrate the relationships between risk management concepts and parameters in a practical, user-friendly way.

## Navigating the Application

Duration: 00:02

The application is structured into three distinct pages, each focusing on a specific aspect of risk management. You can navigate between these pages using the "Navigation" dropdown menu located in the sidebar on the left-hand side of the screen. The sidebar also features a logo of Quant University.

## Page 1: Introduction to Risk

Duration: 00:05

This page serves as an introduction to the fundamental concept of risk. It highlights the importance of risk management in operational contexts. You'll find a table that defines and describes different types of risks commonly encountered in organizations: Operational, Financial, and Strategic. This provides a basic understanding of the various categories of risk that organizations face. A bar chart visually represents these risk types, offering a quick overview of each category.

## Page 2: Risk Assessment

Duration: 00:07

Here, you'll learn about the risk assessment process. A data table presents a simplified risk assessment, considering factors like Likelihood and Impact. It presents three example risks: Cybersecurity breach, Supply chain disruption and Regulatory non-compliance. A "Risk Score" is calculated by multiplying the "Likelihood" and "Impact" for each risk, giving a quantitative measure of the risk's severity. The application then displays a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between "Likelihood" and "Impact," with the size of the data points representing the calculated "Risk Score." The location of the risk on the plot gives a visual understanding of the risks that should be prioritized, i.e., the higher the impact and likelihood, the higher the priority.

## Page 3: Risk Mitigation

Duration: 00:05

This page explores strategies for mitigating risks identified in the assessment phase. A table outlines various risk mitigation strategies, such as Insurance, Redundancy, and Process improvement, alongside descriptions of each strategy. Each strategy represents a method for reducing the impact or likelihood of a risk occurring. A pie chart visualizes the distribution of these strategies, providing a clear overview of different approaches to managing risk. The pie chart shows the contribution of each mitigation strategy.

By exploring each page, you will gain a clearer understanding of risk appetite, risk assessment, and risk mitigation techniques, which are essential components of effective operational risk management.
